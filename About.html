            Hi, I’m Dzunisani Brian Mkhwanazi — a passionate and driven IT professional with over 5 years of experience in hardware, software, and network support, and more than 3 years in sales and customer service. My technical journey began with hands-on support roles, where I honed my skills in troubleshooting, client communication, and system maintenance.</p><br>

        <p>Currently, I’m expanding my skill set by pursuing Full Stack Development through Udemy. I’ve gained practical knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and database integration, and I’m exploring UI/UX design using tools like Figma, Canva, and WordPress.</p><br>
            
            <p>My experience includes working at Afrihost, Aegis/Startek, and Tshwane South TVET College, where I provided front-line support and technical solutions across diverse IT platforms. These roles sharpened my problem-solving skills and taught me the importance of clear communication and customer satisfaction.
            
            I’m enthusiastic about creating user-friendly digital solutions that not only work — but look and feel great too. I’m always eager to learn, collaborate, and bring creative ideas to life in the world of tech.
